            <h1>1) What is the difference between Map,Filter,forEach and find</h1>
            <p><span id="head">The difference between map,filter,forEach,find is:</span> <br>
                <span>Map:</span>  returns a new array that is   the result of calling a provided  function on each element of the original array. <br>
        <span>Filter:  </span>  returns a new array that includes only the elements from the original array that satisfy a provided condition. <br>
        <span>forEach: </span>calls a provided function once for each element in an array, but it does not return anything. <br>
        <span>find:   </span> returns the first element in an array that satisfies a provided condition.
        In summary, map and filter both return new arrays, forEach performs some side-effect on each element, and find returns a single element or undefined.

            <h1>2)What is the difference between localStorage,sessionStorage and cookies</h1>
            <p>Local storage is useful for storing data that the user will need to access later,
            such as offline data. Session storage is a great way to improve the performance
             of your web applications. Cookies are a good choice for storing data that should
              not be persisted for a long time, such as session IDs.</p>

            <h1>3) What is event loop</h1>
            <p>Event loop is manages the execution of multiple asynchronous tasks in a single thread of execution.
            The event loop works by continuously monitoring a queue of events or tasks and processing them in the order they are received. Each event or task is associated with
            a callback function that is executed when the event or task is processed.

            <h1>How does the quizTimer function work</h1>
            <p>The quizTimer function is used to create a timer that counts
                the time elapsed for a quiz. It takes a parameter dismiss,
                which when set to true, clears the timer and stops the countdown. 
                The function uses setInterval to run a callback function every 1000
                milliseconds (1 second), which updates the timer display by calculating
                the minutes and seconds elapsed and displaying them on the HTML page. The function also
                includes logic to change the color of the timer text every 
                60 seconds to create a visual effect for the user.</p>

            <h1>How does the chooseQuiz function work </h1>
            <p>  The quizTimer function is 
                responsible for setting up and controlling a timer for
                a quiz application. The function takes a parameter dismiss
                that is used to stop the timer. The function uses setInterval 
                to create a timer that updates the HTML element with ID count every
                second. The timer is displayed in minutes and seconds format. Additionally,
                after 60 seconds, the timer color changes every 2 seconds between red and 
                dark red to indicate the remaining time. When the dismiss parameter is set to true,
                the clearInterval function is called to stop the timer.</p>
